HELP_TEXT = """**Wordy is a Wordle-like clone that let's you play within Discord.**

Start a game by typing `/wordy <guess>` (replace <guess> with your word) and guess the word the game has secretly chosen. If Wordy returns a gray icon â¬› the letter does not exist. If it returns a yellow icon ðŸŸ¨ the letter exists but is on the wrong spot. If Wordy returns a green icon ðŸŸ© the letter is on the correct spot.

New games are started automatically.

To re-show your current board type `/show`.
To give up use `/surrender`.
